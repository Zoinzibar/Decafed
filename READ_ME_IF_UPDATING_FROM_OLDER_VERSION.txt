!!!!! ​IMPORTANT INFO REGARDING THE NEWEST UPDATE (0.3.0) !!!!!
Before updating please delete any previous BARF versions as the file structure has changed!

- added loot pool rewards for Valuables and Supply crate (Weapon and gear boxes are still WIP cause they were causing profile corruptions)

- Added Woods gladiator key that i forgot to add (Ref has a barter for it using Lega medals which are really hard to obtain in SPT)

- Lowered price on Supply lootbox to 10 and increased the price on Valuables lootbox to 50

- Supply box reward pool includes: Items for crafting, Hideout upgrade items, Electronics, Barter items, Batteries, Flammable materials, Household utilities etc

- Valuables box reward pool includes: Bitcoin, figurines, info items like intel folder and rare crafting books

- Supply box gives out 5 rewards

- Valuables Box gives out 3 rewards due to the smaller pool of items to pull from





Thanks to Kiki this mod now includes config files where you can set the amount of rewards per box and what the boxes give out!

Configs can be found ​in: BARF\src\database

​ItemsToAdd.json - controls which items are added to Ref and their price
